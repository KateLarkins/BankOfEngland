Hi! We are the Local Ladies + Sam. Welcome to our website!

Our team, the Local Ladies + Sam attend Madison Academic Magnet High School.

Let's introduce you to a little backstory:

My name is Kate Larkins, and I am the project manager for the Dev Catalyst competition. A student named Savanna Banks paired up with me to created the 'Local Ladies'. That was our name until another classmate named Sam Murphey joined. Our team has grown a lot since the first few days of Coding. We had to work hard to communicate with each other and learn each others' talents. We learned that Savanna loved organization and structure, Sam liked to work with filler content, and I liked the design aspect. 

We got straight to work searching for a client. We found a couple, but condensed it down to just one that we liked the most and thought had the most potential. We worked for about two weeks on the project. After we had completed the framework for our client, we realized we did not have enough information to fit the requirements to enter the competition. 

So, we got back to work again, and found a new client at the Bank of England Mortgage in Jackson, Tennessee.

Savannah Banks, Samuel Murphey, and I complement each other as a group. 

In fact, Savanna created the entire structure for the site, including cards, the navbar (and navbar button/dropdown), and embedded all iframes (contactpage/map). She worked on every skeleton for each page to be designed, and coded web designs for accordians. She also worked really hard to gather information from our client, and used that to build the Our Team page. Her most impressive additon to this website is a working mortgage calculator. Our client requested one, and Savanna made their ideas a reality. She creatively designed the "House" png on her ipad after our orginal logo design failed to work.

Samuel and Savannah worked together to fill the base structure with all the information needed. They both created legal information pages in the footer and completed filler for all of our dropdown pages. 

At many times, the project proved frusturating, but we worked through them as a team.

Our website would not have been successful if Savanna and Samuel weren't ontop of things everytime I suggested a change. My job was to design all of the pages with fonts, bolded words, develop a color pallet, center text and add padding wherever needed, and assist with anything my group needed. I created both footers, styled them accordingly, and added links where needed. I built the homepage of our site, complete with animations and buttons, and I built the Locations page. The opening image labeled the Jackson Office on our homepage was a challenge for me. Our client had no recent pictures of their office, but wanted one included. Inclement weather hindered our chances to get a pretty "fall" themed picture, so we had to resort to other options. After taking a picture and editing it heavily, I created a copy of the Bank of England Office and made it more inviting. 

We are excited to compete in this Coding competition and have worked hard to do well! We'd like to thank you all for this oppertunity, and we will see you soon!
